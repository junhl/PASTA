Regarding your db_idxr_test.py

Running your test python script (only thing I change was the filename into text into test), d = database_indexer(3, 0.054,n,p) print me:
	{0: ([CAT],[CCT],[CTT],[CGT])}    // notice that I didnt put the '' thing like 'C','A','T'  bcz humans are lazy, and I am one.
	This tells me that at index 0, these are the seeds that passes the treshold of 0.054   , increasing to somethig higher 0.6 gets CAT only, which makes sense.
	What makes it weird is that it only gets the seeds at index 0. I tried reading your code but couldn't figure out why. (My guess is you hard-coded to show only the one at index 0, but couldn't find it.)
	To do the extending part, I kinda need the seeds to run/test. So, I needed seed-generator that I could understand now.

Seed/word generator
	
I re-read about how BLAST work. It seems it searches for word that are 'perfect match'. Which means it doens't allow for any rooms for mismatches or any errors.
So, in our case, the 'perfect match' case is when the db has 1.00 probabiltistic score bcz our query is consisted of only 1.0 scores (query is a 'sure sequence').

In our db, staying at w=3, there are 8325 occurences of such matches (meaning 3 times in a row of 1.00), which is very likely to over all 4^3 possibliiltes. ---> update : this is false...all occurences of 3 times in a row of 1.00 is 'AAA'.  I think this is intended by the prof...
So, my approach of seeds are going over our query seq (ex. AACTG) and the query's w=3 candidates words (this is how BLAST do), AAC,ACT,CTG will be searched in those 6003 occurences of db, therefore significantly reducing the computations to do.
So, out of those 8325, some numbers of words are found as 'perfect match' and they are our seeds/words.


##############################################################################################
Scoring scheme

Now that we have words of w=3, we need to extend.
It gets complicated bcz our db is possibliiltes of nuc. Also, BLAST has multiple scoring matrix/scheme depending on their input type and length.
Our laptop does not have such computing power as BLAST to consider all the parameters that it takes, requiring us to make a 'simple' version.

Things to consider...
First, we can't mutiply the probabilties bcz that would mean the score will keep on going down, and goes down 'dramatically' in case of one case of anything below 0.7
Second, our 'best' scenario or match is when a nuc in db has 1.00 and matches the query's nucloetide at that position, which has 1.00 for all nuc.
	(To consider for conclusion, if our query was probabiltic as well, the matching probabiltic model would be a 'best match' as well. Ex. at pos 0, query got A (0.95) and db got A (0.95))
Third, as the db's nuc will not always be 1.00, we won't have always perfect match cases. We need a way to somewhat penalize in respect to the difference in probabilties and at the same time, promote the extension.

My current scoring scheme is as follows:
top = previousTop + probabilityDifference
bot = prevoiusLength + 1

score = top/bot

ex. We start with a perfect score of 3.0/3.0 with a seed (lets say AAC). 
    Query seq got T after C (1.00 obviously) and DB got C (lets say 0.6) --> score = (3.0+(1.00-0.6))/(4.00)
	If DB had C with higher probabilty, it will be penalized less.
	This way will make probability to be considered as well as the lenth (one mismtach makes less impact with higher length of seq)

Important lines to mention in report 

A single matrix may nevertheless be reasonably efficient over a relatively broad range of evolutionary change (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/html/sub_matrix.html)
 - Our exapmle is very speicific to one chromosome...so not the most general algorithm

Our goal is to create an analog of BLAST that uses probabiltistic alignment.
 - Not to challenge the optimiziation of alignment even further. Staying at its optimizign level.
 - Fewer parameters (one scoring scheme, one seed size, etc) due to the restriction of our computing system compared to BLAST's computing system (our laptop can't handle that much of computation)
 - Similar to how BLAST align stuff.

If the query was probabiltistic model too..
 - include in conclusion part ?
 - 'true' probabiltistic alignment bcz in our case, query is all 1.0
